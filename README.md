## A PurpleSlurple take on Engelbart's Hyperscope Vision: https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/355
### Doug's two top feature contenders are the ability to:
* jump or link directly to any point in any file in the knowledgesphere
* change your view of the file to suit the moment
### The above two features have been supported by the [PurpleSlurple](https://github.com/purpleslurple/PurpleSlurple) concept for decades.
